**_NOTE: THIS IS EFFECTIVELY NULLSAFE BUT CANNOT REFLECT THIS UNTIL cupertino_settings IS UPGRADED._**

A flutter package for building settings forms. This includes a library of pre-built form field widgets. It supports both Material and Cupertino style.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/codegrue/card_settings/blob/master/images/example.png)

This package consists of a CardSettings layout wrapper and a series of form field options including:

- **Text Fields**
  - `CardSettingsText` - Basic text field
  - `CardSettingsParagraph` - Multiline text field with a counter
  - `CardSettingsEmail` - A text field pre-configured for email input
  - `CardSettingsPassword` - A text field pre-configured for passwords
  - `CardSettingsPhone` - A masked phone entry field (US style currently)
- **Numeric Fields**
  - `CardSettingsDouble` - Field for double precision numbers
  - `CardSettingsInt` - Field for integer numbers
  - `CardSettingsCurrency` - Field for currency entry
  - `CardSettingsSwitch` - Field for boolean state
- **Pickers**
  - `CardSettingsListPicker` - Picker list of arbitrary options
  - `CardSettingsNumberPicker` - Picker list of numbers in a given range
  - `CardSettingsRadioPicker` - Single items picker with radio buttons
  - `CardSettingsSelectionPicker` - Single selection from a list with optional icons
  - `CardSettingsCheckboxPicker` - Select multiples from a list of available options
  - `CardSettingsColorPicker` - Picker for colors with three flavors: RGB, Material, and Block
  - `CardSettingsDatePicker` - Date Picker
  - `CardSettingsTimePicker` - Time Picker
  - `CardSettingsDateTimePicker` - Combo Date and Time Picker
  - `CardSettingsFilePicker` - Upload a file from the device
- **Informational Sections**
  - `CardSettingsHeader` - A control to put a header between form sections
  - `CardSettingsInstructions` - Informational read-only text
- **Actions**
  - `CardSettingsButton` - Actions buttons for the form

All fields support `validate`, `onChange`, `onSaved`, `autovalidate`, and `visible`.

The package also includes these additonal items:

- _CardSettingsField_ - The base layout widget. You can use this to build custom fields
- _Converters_ - a set of utility functions to assist in converting data into and out of the fields

## Simple Example

All fields in this package are compatible with the standard Flutter Form widget. Simply wrap the CardSettings control in a form and use it as you normally would with the form functionality.

```dart
  String title = "Spheria";
  String author = "Cody Leet";
  String url = "http://www.codyleet.com/spheria";

  final GlobalKey<FormState> _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      body: Form(
        key: _formKey,
        child: CardSettings(
          children: <CardSettingsSection>[
            CardSettingsSection(
              header: CardSettingsHeader(
                label: 'Favorite Book',
              ),
              children: <CardSettingsWidget>[
                CardSettingsText(
                  label: 'Title',
                  initialValue: title,
                  validator: (value) {
                    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) return 'Title is required.';
                  },
                  onSaved: (value) => title = value,
                ),
                CardSettingsText(
                  label: 'URL',
                  initialValue: url,
                  validator: (value) {
                    if (!value.startsWith('http:')) return 'Must be a valid website.';
                  },
                  onSaved: (value) => url = value,
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
```

If you would like separate cards for each section, then use the `.sectioned` constructor:

```dart
    child: CardSettings.sectioned(
      ...
    ),
```

See the full demo example [here](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/card_settings#-example-tab-).

### Theming

The style of the widgets can be either Material or Cupertino. There is a toggle on the CardSettings widget to globally change the style:

```dart
  return CardSettings(
    showMaterialonIOS: true, // default is false
  );
```

This also exists on each field widget, in case you want to control this more granularly.

If you are using the Material design style, then the `MaterialApp` theme takes effect. This example shows what global theme values to set to determine how the various elements appear.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Card Settings Example',
      home: new HomePage(),
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.teal, // app header background
        secondaryHeaderColor: Colors.indigo[400], // card header background
        cardColor: Colors.white, // card field background
        backgroundColor: Colors.indigo[100], // app background color
        buttonColor: Colors.lightBlueAccent[100], // button background color
        textTheme: TextTheme(
          button: TextStyle(color: Colors.deepPurple[900]), // button text
          subtitle1: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey[800]), // input text
          headline6: TextStyle(color: Colors.white), // card header text
        ),
        primaryTextTheme: TextTheme(
          headline6: TextStyle(color: Colors.lightBlue[50]), // app header text
        ),
        inputDecorationTheme: InputDecorationTheme(
          labelStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.indigo[400]), // style for labels
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

Or if you want to apply a different theme to the `CardSettings` hierarchy only, you can wrap it in a `Theme` widget like so:

```dart
  Theme(
    data: Theme.of(context).copyWith(
      primaryTextTheme: TextTheme(
        headline6: TextStyle(color: Colors.lightBlue[50]), // app header text
      ),
      inputDecorationTheme: InputDecorationTheme(
        labelStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.deepPurple), // style for labels
      ),
    ),
    child: CardSettings(
      ...
    ),
  )
```

Please see <https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_material_pickers#-readme-tab-> for information on how to theme the dialog popups.

### Card Style

By default, in Material mode, the content is inside a Card or Cards (if sectioned).

![Carded](https://github.com/codegrue/card_settings/blob/master/images/carded_example.png)

If you would rather just have a flat style with no border, set `cardless` to false.

![Cardless](https://github.com/codegrue/card_settings/blob/master/images/cardless_example.png)

```dart
  return CardSettings(
    cardless: true; // default is false
  );
```

This has no effect in Cupertino mode, as that doesn't have a card to begin with.

You can also change the actual card styleing through the theme for example:

![Custom](https://github.com/codegrue/card_settings/blob/master/images/custom_border_example.png)

```dart
  cardTheme: CardTheme(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      side: BorderSide(width: 2, color: Colors.orange),
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
    ),
  ),
```

### Global Properties

The `CardSettings` widget implements a few global settings that all child fields can inherit. Currently it supports only label customization.

#### Labels

You can control how the labels are rendered with four properties:

```dart
  CardSettings(
    labelAlign: TextAlign.right, // change the label alignment
    labelWidth: 120.0, // change how wide the label portion is
    labelSuffix: ':', // add an optional tag after the label
    labelPadding: 10.0, // control the spacing between the label and the content
    contentAlign: TextAlign.left, // alignment of the entry widgets
    icon: Icon(Icons.person), // puts and option icon to the left of the label
    requiredIndicator: Text('*', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red)), // puts an optional indicator to the right of the label
  )
```

The `labelAlign` and `contentAlign` properties are also available on each field, so you can override the global setting for individual fields.

```dart
  CardSettingsText(
    label: 'Last Name',
    labelAlign: TextAlign.left,
    contentAlign: TextAlign.right,
  )
```

### Headers

`CardSettingsHeader` provides properties to set the color, height, and label alignment. However, if you wish to completely override the default header style and replace it with something custom, you can use the `child` property to pass in your own widget tree:

```dart
header: CardSettingsHeader(
  child: Container(
    height: 80,
    child: Row(
      children: [
        Expanded(child: Divider(color: Colors.purple, thickness: 5)),
        Text('Custom Header', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)),
        Expanded(child: Divider(color: Colors.purple, thickness: 5)),
      ],
    ),
  ),
),
```

### Dynamic Visibility

Each field implements a `visible` property that you can use to control the visibility based on the value of other fields. In this example, the switch field controls the visibility of the text field:

```dart
  bool _ateOut = false;

  CardSettingsSwitch(
    label: 'Ate out?',
    initialValue: _ateOut,
    onChanged: (value) => setState(() => _ateOut = value),
  ),

  CardSettingsText(
    label: 'Restaurant',
    visible: _ateOut,
  ),
```

### Masking

The `CardSettingsText` widget has an `inputMask` property that forces entered text to conform to a given pattern. This is built upon the [flutter_masked_text](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_masked_text)
package and as such masks are formatted with the following characters:

- 0: accept numbers
- A: accept letters
- @: accept numbers and letters
- \*: accept any character

So for example, phone number would be '(000) 000-0000'.

Note: `CardSettingsPhone` is a convenience widget that is pre-configured to use this pattern.

Caution: `flutter_masked_text` is a controller and as such, you will not be able to use an inputMask and a custom controller at the same time. This might be rectified in the future.

### Orientation

This suite allows for orientation switching. To configure this, build different layouts depending on the orientation provided by `MediaQuery`.

You might want to have different fields in each layout, or a different field order. So that Flutter doesn't get confused tracking state under this circumstance, you must provide a unique state key for each individual field, using the same key in each layout.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {

  final GlobalKey<FormState> _emailKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  var orientation = MediaQuery.of(context).orientation;

  return Form
    key: _formKey,(
    child: (orientation == Orientation.portraitUp)
        ? CardSettings(children: <Widget>[
              // Portrait layout here
              CardSettingsEmail(key: _emailKey)
            ])
        : CardSettings(children: <Widget>[
              // Landscape layout here
              CardSettingsEmail(key: _emailKey)
            ]);
    },
  );
}
```

You may have multiple fields on the same row in landscape orientation. This normally requires the use of container widgets to provide the layout inside the row. Instead, you can use the `CardFieldLayout` helper widget to streamline this. It will by default make it's children equally spaced, but you can provide an array of flex values to control the relative sizes.

```dart
// equally spaced example
CardSettings(
  children: <Widget>[
    CardFieldLayout(children: <Widget>[
      CardSettingsEmail(),
      CardSettingsPassword(),
    ]),
  ],
);
```

```dart
// relative width example
CardSettings(
  children: <Widget>[
    CardFieldLayout_FractionallySpaced(
      children: <Widget>[
        CardSettingsEmail(),
        CardSettingsPassword(),
      ],
      flexValues: [2, 1], // 66% and 33% widths
    ),
  ],
);
```

### Custom Fields

The `CardSettingsField` is the basis of all other fields and can be used to build unique fields outside of this library. Its purpose is to govern layout with consistent decorations. The best way to make a custom field is to inherit from `FormField<T>`, which will manage the state of your field. The cleanest example of this is the `CardSettingsSwitch` widget. All you have to do is provide your custom widgets in the `content` property.

### Custom Widgets

If you wish to provide a custom widget that is _not_ a field type layout, you need to implement the `CardSettingsWidget` interface as so:

```dart
class CardSettingsHeader extends StatelessWidget implements CardSettingsWidget {
  ...
}
```
